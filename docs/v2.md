# v2 notes

## core

#### smesh

bootstrap a cluster of machines with docker and etcd - this is our physical pool of computers

#### server

the viking server process - runs on all server nodes providing the HTTP api and the cli and clients connect to

#### floki

keep track of our fleet of servers

#### viking-proc

the deamonized jobs are written here as a statement of intent

#### viking-ps

list the currently running jobs so we can check against proc and determine actions needed to be taken

#### embassy

auto-networking ambassador run on each computer - containers can auto-route to other services via the ambassador

#### dowding

logic to allocate a server for a job - based on current load / tags and history of the job

## jobs

Everything boils down to wanting to run a process or 'job'.

A job is a JSON object that describes how to create a docker run command.

Job properties:

 * name - a single string that must be unique to the cluster
 * volumes - an array of data volumes - they are mounted in the viking data directory
 * image
 * ports
 * command

A job has several flags that controls how it will run:

### deamonize

true or false (default false - true if ports.length)

A demonized job is any kind of tcp/ucp server that is long-lived.

A non-demonized job is a standard stdin/stdout process that will auto-remove after running

### fixed

true or false (default false - true if volumes.length or static)

A fixed job will always run on the same server - this is used if the job uses data volumes

### static

true or false (default false)

A static job will not restart on new code pushes - this is good for external servers that are not part of the codebase being pushed


### running jobs

When a job is run:

 * use the name to load the history of the job - this can determine if it is fixed onto one server
 * check if the job has volumes or has VIKING_FIXED environment variable set - if so we choose a fixed server
 * check the --viking-host and --viking-filter argument for server tags
 * use the above information to pipe into dowding and get the machine we will run the job
 * if the job is interactive it will hook up stdin and stdout to the container - this enables piping of viking jobs
 * it will then run the job via the docker HTTP api for the choosen server
 * on error - delete the job from viking-proc (if deamonized)
 * on exit - if deamonized then get docker status and write it to viking-ps
